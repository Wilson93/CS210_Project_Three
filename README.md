# CS210_Project_Three
-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
So this project was to help a local grocery store manage their inventory
-What did you do particularly well
I thought adding multiple files into one directory would have me run into some issues but it went fairly smoothly and I learned a lot
-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think making the interface a bit more user friendly would be a good start and maybe even adding an extra suggestion button where someone could type in things they would like to see in the program
-Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network. 
So I used VS code for this project and I felt like using the different C++ builder plugins kinda threw me for a loop but Ive learned to love visual studio code I think its an insanely helpful program and definitely what ill be using for my future projects.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think using git and github is going to be very helpful for all of my future coding endevours.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think the biggest thing here is to code your project as if you were going to add things later and then run your project as if you were the consumer to see if it runs how you would want it to run if you were having to use it every day.
